## "but how many makeups do i REALLY need?"

Truly this project is just me experimenting and trying to figure out how to use React and JSX, but I figured it'd be fun to do a calculator for how much working out one actually has to do in Weights in order to achieve a certain grade, or else get stuck doing makeups at the end of the semester.

Curious how you'd stack up? [Try it here!](https://weights.mikeylab.com)
